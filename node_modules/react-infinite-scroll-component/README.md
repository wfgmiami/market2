# using

```jsx
<InfiniteScroll
  pullDownToRefresh
  pullDownToRefreshContent={
    <h3 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>&#8595; Pull down to refresh</h3>
  }
  releaseToRefreshContent={
    <h3 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>&#8593; Release to refresh</h3>
  }
  refreshFunction={this.refresh}
  next={fetchData}
  hasMore={true}
  loader={<h4>Loading...</h4>}
  endMessage={
    <p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
      <b>Yay! You have seen it all</b>
    </p>
  }>
  {items}
</InfiniteScroll>
```

The `InfiniteScroll` component can be used in two ways.

- Without giving any height to your **scrollable** content. In which case the scroll will happen at `document.body` like *Facebook's* timeline scroll.
- If you want your **scrollable** content to have a definite height then your content will be scrollable with the height specified in the props.

# props
name | type | description
-----|------|------------
**next** | function | a function which must be called after reaching the bottom. It must trigger some sort of action which fetches the next data. **The data is passed as `children` to the `InfiniteScroll` component and the data should contain previous items too.** e.g. *Initial data = [1, 2, 3]* and then next load of data should be *[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]*.
**hasMore** | boolean | it tells the InfiniteScroll component on whether to call `next` function on reaching the bottom and shows an `endMessage` to the user
**children** | node (list) | the data items which you need to scroll.
**loader** | node | you can send a loader component to show while the component waits for the next load of data. e.g. `<h3>Loading...</h3>` or any fancy loader element
**scrollThreshold** | number | a threshold value after that the InfiniteScroll will call `next`. By default it's `0.8`. It means the `next` will be called when the user comes below 80% of the total height.
**onScroll** | function | a function that will listen to the scroll event on the scrolling container. Note that the scroll event is throttled, so you may not receive as many events as you would expect. 
**endMessage** | node |  this message is shown to the user when he has seen all the records which means he's at the bottom and `hasMore` is `false`
**style** | object | any style which you want to override
**height** | number | optional, give only if you want to have a fixed height scrolling content
**hasChildren** | bool | `children` is by default assumed to be of type array and it's length is used to determine if loader needs to be shown or not, if your `children` is not an array, specify this prop to tell if your items are 0 or more.
**pullDownToRefresh** | bool | to enable **Pull Down to Refresh** feature
**pullDownToRefreshContent** | node | any JSX that you want to show the user, `default={<h3>Pull down to refresh</h3>}`
**releaseToRefreshContent** | node | any JSX that you want to show the user, `default={<h3>Release to refresh</h3>}`
**pullDownToRefreshThreshold** | number | minimum distance the user needs to pull down to trigger the refresh, `default=100px`
**refreshFunction** | function | this function will be called, it should return the fresh data that you want to show the user
**initialScrollY** | number | set a scroll y position for the component to render with.
